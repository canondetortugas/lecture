0.  How much time did you spend on this pre-class exercise, and when?

    1 hour, the night before class.

1.  What are one or two points that you found least clear in the
    10/08 slide decks (including the narration)?

    The discussion of the MPI model could be a little more concrete - more diagrams would be helpful.

2.  Now that we are now basically a third of the way into the
    semester, and are (mostly) settled into the steady pace of things,
    I would appreciate your feedback on what is working well or poorly
    about the class.  Comments on things I can reasonably change are
    particularly useful -- venting about the cluster, for example, is
    understandable but doesn't help me that much in adjusting!

    I'm not a huge fan of the way we usually do in-class questions - too many people opt not to answer.   

3.  The ring demo implements the protocol described in the particle
    systems slide deck from 9/15:

    a) In your own words, describe what ring.c is doing.

    If we imagine the processes we are using arranged as a ring, the performs the computation task in parallel through a strategy in which each process in the ring communicates with its predecessor and succesor in the ring.

    b) How might you modify the code to have the same computational
       pattern, but using non-blocking communication rather than
       MPI_Sendrecv?  Note that according to the MPI standard,
       one isn't supposed to read from a buffer that is being
       handled by a non-blocking send, so it is probably necessary
       to use three temporary buffers rather than the current two.

       Try to use some of the primitives like MPI_Scatterv.
